<h1 ><strong>FEACP Evaluation</strong></h1>
<p>Project FEACP-Evaluation was created to test the performance of FEACP, FEACP(without sub-tree utility), and CLH-Miner algorithms. The project includes the source code and information about the dataset and the taxonomy corresponding to that dataset.</p>
<h2 >Prerequisites</h2>
<p> Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>You have installed the Eclipse and JDK 8 or later. </li>
<li>You are using a Windows machine. </li>

</ul>
<h2 >Structure of Project</h2>
